.SH DESCRIPTION

Print ARGUMENT(s) according to FORMAT, or execute according to OPTION:

FORMAT controls the output. Interpreted sequences:

% - Each conversion specifier is prefixed by the
.B %
character
.TP

Conversion specifiers:

c - Prints a single character. The argument passed for specifier "%c" is of type int. which is then
converted to an unsigned char, which is then written. 

s - Print a string of characters. The argument passed for specifier "%s" is a literal string in a
constant char *, which will be a pointer to an array of character type that points to a string.
Characters from the array are written up to (but not including ) the terminating null bye ('/0').
does not take any options.

d, i - Print an integer number of base 10. The argument passed for specifiers "%d" and "%i" is an
int argument converted into signed decimal notation. In _printf, the specifiers are handled the same
way. The precision functionality, the number of digits that appears in beginning, is still in
development and will be added at an later time.

% - Print a single % character. The argument passed is not converted and will simply be written as
% "%". To write out "%", format must be "%%". 

R - print a string in ROT13 code
